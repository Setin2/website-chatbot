# Website

This is a prototype website made to work using flask. Main focus was the implementation of the chatbot interface.

The torch framework takes up too much space to publish for free anywhere, so the published version chatbot does not use machine learning. To try the flask version, simplty clone the repository and call

```
app.py
```

Then open the link provided by the console in any browser of your choice.
